# SimpleCalculatorJS
This JavaScript project is a very simplified version of a calculator.

The project objective/specs were as follows:

Create an webpage with two text fields that will be used to obtain two numbers from the user. Then there should be two buttons, one labeled Multiply and the other labeled Divide. Each button will call a different function that will return the result of the operation to a third text field.
